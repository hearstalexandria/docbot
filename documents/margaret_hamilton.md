**Margaret Elaine Hamilton** (`{{nee|'''Heafield'''}}`{=mediawiki}; born
August 17, 1936) is an American [computer
scientist](computer_scientist "wikilink"), [systems
engineer](systems_engineer "wikilink"), and business owner. She was
director of the Software Engineering Division of the [MIT
Instrumentation Laboratory](Draper_Laboratory "wikilink"), which
developed on-board flight software for [NASA](NASA "wikilink")\'s
[Apollo program](Apollo_program "wikilink"). She later founded two
software companies---Higher Order Software in 1976 and Hamilton
Technologies in 1986, both in [Cambridge,
Massachusetts](Cambridge,_Massachusetts "wikilink").

Hamilton has published more than 130 papers, proceedings, and reports,
about sixty projects, and six major programs. She invented the term
\"[software engineering](software_engineering "wikilink")\",[^1] stating
\"I began to use the term 'software engineering' to distinguish it from
hardware and other kinds of engineering, yet treat each type of
engineering as part of the overall systems engineering
process.\"[^2][^3][^4]

On November 22, 2016, Hamilton received the [Presidential Medal of
Freedom](Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom "wikilink") from president
[Barack Obama](Barack_Obama "wikilink") for her work leading to the
development of on-board flight software for NASA\'s Apollo Moon
missions.[^5]

## Early life and education {#early_life_and_education}

Margaret Elaine Heafield was born August 17, 1936, in [Paoli,
Indiana](Paoli,_Indiana "wikilink"),[^6] to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth
Esther Heafield (`{{Nee|Partington}}`{=mediawiki}).[^7][^8] The family
later moved to [Michigan](Michigan "wikilink"),[^9] where Margaret
graduated from [Hancock High
School](Hancock_High_School_(Michigan) "wikilink") in 1954.[^10] She
studied mathematics at the [University of
Michigan](University_of_Michigan "wikilink") in 1955 before transferring
to [Earlham College](Earlham_College "wikilink"), where her mother had
been a student;[^11][^12] she earned a BA in mathematics with a minor in
philosophy in 1958.[^13][^14] She cites Florence Long, the head of the
math department at Earlham, as helping with her desire to pursue
abstract mathematics and become a mathematics professor.[^15] She says
her poet father and headmaster grandfather inspired her to include a
minor in philosophy in her studies.[^16]

## Career

In Boston, Hamilton initially intended to enroll in graduate study in
[abstract mathematics](abstract_mathematics "wikilink") at [Brandeis
University](Brandeis_University "wikilink").[^17] However, in mid-1959,
Hamilton began working for [Edward Norton
Lorenz](Edward_Norton_Lorenz "wikilink"), in the
[meteorology](meteorology "wikilink") department at
[MIT](MIT "wikilink").[^18] She developed software for predicting
weather, programming on the [LGP-30](LGP-30 "wikilink") and the
[PDP-1](PDP-1 "wikilink") computers at [Marvin
Minsky](Marvin_Minsky "wikilink")\'s [Project
MAC](MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory#Project_MAC "wikilink").[^19][^20][^21]
Her work contributed to Lorenz\'s publications on [chaos
theory](chaos_theory "wikilink"). At the time, [computer
science](computer_science "wikilink") and [software
engineering](software_engineering "wikilink") were not yet established
disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on
experience.[^22] She moved on to another project in the summer of 1961,
and hired and trained [Ellen Fetter](Ellen_Fetter "wikilink") as her
replacement.[^23]

### SAGE Project {#sage_project}

From 1961 to 1963, Hamilton worked on the [Semi-Automatic Ground
Environment](Semi-Automatic_Ground_Environment "wikilink") (SAGE)
Project at [the MIT Lincoln
Lab](MIT_Lincoln_Laboratory "wikilink"),[^24] where she was one of the
programmers who wrote software for the prototype [AN/FSQ-7 computer (the
XD-1)](AN/FSQ-7_Combat_Direction_Central "wikilink"), used by the [U.S.
Air Force](United_States_Air_Force "wikilink") to search for possibly
unfriendly aircraft.[^25] She also wrote software for a satellite
tracking project at the [Air Force Cambridge Research
Laboratories](Air_Force_Cambridge_Research_Laboratories "wikilink").[^26]
The SAGE Project was an extension of [Project
Whirlwind](Whirlwind_I "wikilink"), started by
[MIT](Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "wikilink") to create a
computer system that could predict weather systems and track their
movements using simulators. SAGE was soon developed for military use in
anti-aircraft air defense. Hamilton said:

```{=mediawiki}
{{Blockquote|What they used to do when you came into this organization as a beginner, was to assign you this program which nobody was able to ever figure out or get to run. When I was the beginner they gave it to me as well. And what had happened was it was tricky programming, and the person who wrote it took delight in the fact that all of his comments were in Greek and Latin. So I was assigned this program and I actually got it to work. It even printed out its answers in Latin and Greek. I was the first one to get it to work.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/5456/1/hrst.mit.edu/hrs/apollo/public/conference1/hamilton-intro.htm |title=AGC – Conference 1: Margaret Hamilton's introduction |website=authors.library.caltech.edu |access-date=December 9, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160131233720/http://authors.library.caltech.edu/5456/1/hrst.mit.edu/hrs/apollo/public/conference1/hamilton-intro.htm|archive-date = January 31, 2016|url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}
```
It was her efforts on this project that made her a candidate for the
position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo flight software.[^27]

### MIT Instrumentation Laboratory and the Apollo Guidance Computer {#mit_instrumentation_laboratory_and_the_apollo_guidance_computer}

![Hamilton in 1969, standing next to listings of the software she and

project[^28]](Margaret_Hamilton_-_restoration.jpg "Hamilton in 1969, standing next to listings of the software she and her MIT team produced for the Apollo project")
![Hamilton during her time as lead Apollo flight software
designer[^30]](Margaret_Hamilton_in_action.jpg "Hamilton during her time as lead Apollo flight software designer")

Hamilton then joined the [MIT Instrumentation
Laboratory](MIT_Instrumentation_Laboratory "wikilink"), which developed
the [Apollo Guidance Computer](Apollo_Guidance_Computer "wikilink") for
the [Apollo lunar exploration program](Apollo_program "wikilink").
Hamilton was the first programmer hired for the Apollo project and in
1965 became Director of the Software Engineering Division.[^32][^33] She
was responsible for the team writing and testing all on board in flight
software for the [Apollo](Apollo_(spacecraft) "wikilink") spacecraft\'s
[Command](Apollo_command_and_service_module "wikilink") and [Lunar
Module](Apollo_Lunar_Module "wikilink") and for the subsequent [Skylab
space station](Skylab "wikilink").[^34][^35][^36] Another part of her
team designed and developed the systems software.[^37] This included
error detection and recovery software such as restarts and the Display
Interface Routines (also known as the Priority Displays), which Hamilton
designed and developed.[^38] She worked to gain hands-on experience
during a time when computer science courses were uncommon and software
engineering courses did not exist.[^39]

Her areas of expertise include: [systems
design](systems_design "wikilink") and [software
development](software_development "wikilink"),
[enterprise](Enterprise_modelling "wikilink") and [process
modeling](Business_process_modeling "wikilink"), development paradigm,
formal [systems modeling](systems_modeling "wikilink") languages,
system-oriented objects for systems modeling and development, automated
life-cycle environments, methods for maximizing [software
reliability](software_reliability "wikilink") and
[reuse](software_reuse "wikilink"), [domain
analysis](domain_analysis "wikilink"),
[correctness](Correctness_(computer_science) "wikilink") by built-in
language properties, open-architecture techniques for robust systems,
full life-cycle automation, [quality
assurance](quality_assurance "wikilink"), seamless integration, [error
detection and recovery](error_handling "wikilink") techniques,
[human-machine interface](human-machine_interface "wikilink") systems,
[operating systems](operating_system "wikilink"), end-to-end testing
techniques, and life-cycle management techniques.[^40][^41] These
techniques are intended to make code more reliable because they help
programmers identify and fix errors sooner in the development process.

#### Apollo 11 landing {#apollo_11_landing}

In one of the critical moments of the [Apollo 11](Apollo_11 "wikilink")
mission, the [Apollo Guidance
Computer](Apollo_Guidance_Computer "wikilink"), together with the
on-board flight software, averted an abort of the landing on the Moon.
Three minutes before the [lunar lander](Apollo_Lunar_Module "wikilink")
reached the Moon\'s surface, several computer alarms were triggered. The
on-board flight software captured these alarms with the \"never supposed
to happen displays\" interrupting the astronauts with priority alarm
displays.[^42] Hamilton had prepared for just this situation years
before:
`{{Blockquote|There was one other failsafe that Hamilton likes to remember. Her "priority display" innovation had created a knock-on risk that astronaut and computer would slip out of synch just when it mattered most. As the alarms went off and priority displays replaced normal ones, the actual switchover to new programmes behind the screens was happening "a step slower" than it would today.

Hamilton had thought long and hard about this. It meant that if Aldrin, say, hit a button on the priority display too quickly, he might still get a "normal" response. Her solution: when you see a priority display, first count to
five.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://members.tortoisemedia.com/2019/07/13/nasa-margaret/content.html |website=Tortoise Media |last=Whittell |first=Giles |title=First Woman |date=July 13, 2004}}</ref>
}}`{=mediawiki} By some accounts, the astronauts had inadvertently left
the rendezvous radar switch on, causing these alarms to be triggered
(the claim that the radar was left on inadvertently by the astronauts is
disputed by Robert Wills with [the National Museum of
Computing](the_National_Museum_of_Computing "wikilink")[^43]). The
computer was overloaded with interrupts caused by incorrectly
[phased](three-phase_electric_power "wikilink") power supplied to the
lander\'s rendezvous radar.[^44][^45][^46] The program alarms indicated
\"executive overflows\", meaning the guidance computer could not
complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of
them.[^47] The asynchronous executive designed by [J. Halcombe
Laning](J._Halcombe_Laning "wikilink")[^48][^49][^50] was used by
Hamilton\'s team to develop asynchronous flight software:

```{=mediawiki}
{{Blockquote|Because of the flight software's system-software's error detection and recovery techniques that included its system-wide "kill and recompute" from a "safe place" restart approach to its snapshot and rollback techniques, the Display Interface Routines (AKA the priority displays) together with its man-in-the-loop capabilities were able to be created in order to have the capability to interrupt the astronauts' normal mission displays with priority displays of critical alarms in case of an emergency. This depended on our assigning a unique priority to every process in the software in order to ensure that all of its events would take place in the correct order and at the right time relative to everything else that was going on.<ref name="auto">Snyder, Lawrence and Henry, Ray Laura, "Fluency7 with Information Technology", Pearson, {{ISBN|0-13-444872-3}}</ref>}}
```
Hamilton\'s priority alarm displays interrupted the astronauts\' normal
displays to warn them that there was an emergency \"giving the
astronauts a [go/no go](go/no_go "wikilink") decision (to land or not to
land)\".[^51] [Jack Garman](Jack_Garman "wikilink"), a NASA computer
engineer in mission control, recognized the meaning of the errors that
were presented to the astronauts by the priority displays and shouted,
\"Go, go!\" and they continued.[^52] Paul Curto, senior technologist who
nominated Hamilton for a NASA Space Act Award, called Hamilton\'s work
\"the foundation for ultra-reliable software design\".[^53]

Hamilton later wrote of the incident:

```{=mediawiki}
{{blockquote|The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, 'I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks'; i.e., the ones needed for landing&nbsp;... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones&nbsp;... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was.

```
### Businesses

In 1976, Hamilton co-founded with Saydean Zeldin a company called Higher
Order Software (HOS)[^54] to further develop ideas about error
prevention and fault tolerance emerging from their experience at MIT
working on the Apollo program.[^55][^56] They created a product called
USE.IT, based on the HOS methodology they developed at
MIT.[^57][^58][^59] It was successfully used in numerous government
programs[^60][^61] including a project to formalize and implement
C-IDEF, an automated version of [IDEF](IDEF "wikilink"), a [modeling
language](modeling_language "wikilink") developed by the U.S. Air Force
in the [Integrated Computer-Aided
Manufacturing](Integrated_Computer-Aided_Manufacturing "wikilink")
(ICAM) project.[^62] In 1980, British-Israeli computer scientist [David
Harel](David_Harel "wikilink") published a proposal for a structured
programming language derived from HOS from the viewpoint of
[and/or](Logical_conjunction#Applications_in_computer_engineering "wikilink")
subgoals.[^63] Others have used HOS to formalize the semantics of
linguistic quantifiers,[^64] and to formalize the design of reliable
real-time embedded systems.[^65]

Hamilton was the CEO of HOS through 1984[^66] and left the company in
1985. In March 1986, she founded Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in
[Cambridge, Massachusetts](Cambridge,_Massachusetts "wikilink"). The
company was developed around the [Universal Systems
Language](Universal_Systems_Language "wikilink") (USL) and its
associated automated environment, the 001 Tool Suite, based on her
paradigm of development before the fact for systems design and software
development.[^67][^68][^69]

## Legacy

![Official photo for [NASA](NASA "wikilink"),
1989](Margaret_Hamilton_1989.jpg "Official photo for NASA, 1989")
Hamilton has been credited with naming the discipline of \"[software
engineering](software_engineering "wikilink")\".[^70][^71][^72] Hamilton
details how she came to make up the term \"software engineering\":

```{=mediawiki}
{{Blockquote|When I first came up with the term, no one had heard of it before, at least in our world. It was an ongoing joke for a long time. They liked to kid me about my radical ideas. It was a memorable day when one of the most respected hardware gurus explained to everyone in a meeting that he agreed with me that the process of building software should also be considered an engineering discipline, just like with hardware. Not because of his acceptance of the new 'term' per se, but because we had earned his and the acceptance of the others in the room as being in an engineering field in its own right.<ref name="auto" />}}
```
When Hamilton started using the term \"software engineering\" during the
early Apollo missions,[^73] software development was not taken seriously
compared to other engineering,[^74] nor was it regarded as a science.
Hamilton was concerned with legitimizing software development as an
engineering discipline.[^75] Over time the term \"software engineering\"
gained the same respect as any other technical discipline.[^76][^77] The
IEEE Software September/October 2018 issue celebrates the 50th
anniversary of software engineering.[^78] Hamilton talks about
\"Errors\" and how they influenced her work related to software
engineering and how her language, USL, could be used to prevent the
majority of \"Errors\" in a system.[^79] Writing in
*[Wired](Wired_(magazine) "wikilink")*, Robert McMillan noted: \"At MIT
she assisted in the creation of the core principles in computer
programming as she worked with her colleagues in writing code for the
world\'s first portable computer\".[^80] Hamilton\'s innovations go
beyond the feats of playing an important role in getting humans to the
Moon. According to *Wired*{{\'}}s Karen Tegan Padir: \"She, along with
that other early programming pioneer, [COBOL](COBOL "wikilink") inventor
[Grace Hopper](Grace_Hopper "wikilink"), also deserve tremendous credit
for helping to open the door for more women to enter and succeed in STEM
fields like software.\"[^81][^82]

In 2019, to celebrate 50 years to the Apollo landing, Google decided to
make a tribute to Hamilton. The mirrors at the Ivanpah plant were
configured to create a picture of Hamilton and the Apollo 11 by
moonlight.[^83]

## Personal life {#personal_life}

Hamilton has a sister Kathryn.[^101]

She met her first husband, James Cox Hamilton,[^102] in the mid-1950s
while attending college. They were married on June 15, 1958, the summer
after she graduated from Earlham.[^103][^104] She briefly taught high
school mathematics and French at a public school in [Boston,
Indiana](Boston,_Indiana "wikilink").[^105][^106] The couple then moved
to [Boston](Boston "wikilink"),
[Massachusetts](Massachusetts "wikilink"),[^107] where they had a
daughter, Lauren, born on November 10, 1959.[^108] They divorced in 1967
and Margaret married Dan Lickly two years later.[^109][^110]
