The **Charlotte Hornets** are an American professional
[basketball](basketball "wikilink") team based in [Charlotte, North
Carolina](Charlotte,_North_Carolina "wikilink"). The Hornets compete in
the [National Basketball
Association](National_Basketball_Association "wikilink") (NBA) as a
member of the league\'s [Eastern
Conference](Eastern_Conference_(NBA) "wikilink") [Southeast
Division](Southeast_Division_(NBA) "wikilink"), and play their home
games at the [Spectrum Center](Spectrum_Center_(arena) "wikilink") in
[Uptown Charlotte](Uptown_Charlotte "wikilink"). The Hornets are mainly
owned by [Basketball Hall of
Famer](Naismith_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame "wikilink") [Michael
Jordan](Michael_Jordan "wikilink"), who acquired a [controlling
interest](controlling_interest "wikilink") in the team in 2010.[^1][^2]

The [Charlotte Hornets
franchise](History_of_the_Charlotte_Hornets "wikilink") was established
in [1988](1988–89_NBA_season "wikilink") as an [expansion
team](expansion_team "wikilink") owned by [George
Shinn](George_Shinn "wikilink"). In
[2002](2002–03_NBA_season "wikilink"), Shinn moved the Hornets to [New
Orleans](New_Orleans "wikilink") as an expansion team. They continued to
play as the Hornets until 2013, when they changed their name to the [New
Orleans Pelicans](New_Orleans_Pelicans "wikilink").

As part of an agreement with the NBA, Charlotte returned for the
[2004--05 NBA season](2004–05_NBA_season "wikilink"), known as the
**Charlotte Bobcats.**[^3] In 2013, the Bobcats announced they would
rebrand to the Charlotte Hornets beginning with the [2014--15
season](2014–15_NBA_season "wikilink").[^4][^5][^6] On the day the name
change became official, the franchise reclaimed the history and records
of the original Charlotte Hornets spanning from 1988 to 2002. As a
result, the league considers the Hornets retrospectively having
suspended operations from 2002 to 2004.

### 1988--2002: Original Charlotte Hornets {#original_charlotte_hornets}

#### 1985--1988: Birth of the Hornets {#birth_of_the_hornets}

In 1985, the NBA was planning to expand by three teams by the 1988--89
season, later modified to include a total of four expansion teams.
[George Shinn](George_Shinn "wikilink"), an entrepreneur from
[Kannapolis](Kannapolis,_North_Carolina "wikilink"), wanted to bring an
NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent
local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area
had long been a hotbed for [college
basketball](college_basketball "wikilink"). Charlotte was also one of
the fastest-growing cities in the United States,[^7] and was previously
one of the three in-state regional homes to the [American Basketball
Association](American_Basketball_Association "wikilink")\'s (ABA)
[Carolina Cougars](Carolina_Cougars "wikilink") from 1969 to 1974.[^8]

![[Doug Moe](Doug_Moe "wikilink") of the
[ABA](American_Basketball_Association "wikilink")\'s [Carolina
Cougars](Carolina_Cougars "wikilink"), which existed from 1969 to
1974](Ollie_Darden_and_Doug_Moe.jpeg "Doug Moe of the ABA's Carolina Cougars, which existed from 1969 to 1974")
Despite doubt from critics,[^9] Shinn\'s [ace in the
hole](:wikt:ace_in_the_hole "wikilink") was the [Charlotte
Coliseum](Charlotte_Coliseum "wikilink"), a state-of-the-art arena that
would seat almost 24,000 spectators, the largest basketball-specific
arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5,
1987, then-[NBA Commissioner](Commissioner_of_the_NBA "wikilink") [David
Stern](David_Stern "wikilink") called Shinn to tell him his group had
been awarded the 24th NBA franchise, to begin play in
[1988](1988–89_NBA_season "wikilink"). Franchises were also granted to
[Miami](Miami_Heat "wikilink"), [Minneapolis--Saint
Paul](Minnesota_Timberwolves "wikilink"), and
[Orlando](Orlando_Magic "wikilink").

Originally, the new team was going to be called the *Charlotte Spirit*,
but a name-the-team contest yielded \"Hornets\" as the winning choice.
The name originates from British [General
Cornwallis](Charles_Cornwallis,_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis "wikilink"), who
allegedly described the city as \"a hornet\'s nest of rebellion\"
following the [Battle of Charlotte](Battle_of_Charlotte "wikilink") in
1780, though it was first attested in 1819.[^10] The team received
further attention when it chose [teal](teal "wikilink") as its primary
color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early
1990s.[^11] The team\'s uniforms, designed by international designer and
North Carolina native [Alexander Julian](Alexander_Julian "wikilink"),
featured a first for NBA uniforms---[pin
stripes](pin_stripes "wikilink").[^12] Similar designs by other teams
followed, as they became a hit.

Shinn hired [Carl Scheer](Carl_Scheer "wikilink") as the team\'s first
President and General Manager.[^13] Scheer preferred a roster of veteran
players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible.
Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant [Dick
Harter](Dick_Harter "wikilink") was hired as the team\'s first head
coach.[^14] In 1988, the Hornets and the [Miami
Heat](Miami_Heat "wikilink") were part of the [1988 NBA Expansion
Draft](1988_NBA_Expansion_Draft "wikilink"). Unlike many expansion
franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of
young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several
veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right
away. The team also had three draft picks at the [1988 NBA
draft](1988_NBA_draft "wikilink").[^15]

#### 1988--1992: Early seasons {#early_seasons}

![Season tickets for the Hornets\' [inaugural
season](1988–89_Charlotte_Hornets_season "wikilink").](1988-89_Charlotte_Hornets_Season_Ticket_Book_01.jpg "Season tickets for the Hornets' inaugural season."){width="280"}
The Hornets\' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the
[Charlotte Coliseum](Charlotte_Coliseum "wikilink"), losing 133--93 to
the [Cleveland Cavaliers](Cleveland_Cavaliers "wikilink").[^16] Four
days later, the team notched its first-ever victory over the [Los
Angeles Clippers](Los_Angeles_Clippers "wikilink"), 117--105.[^17] On
December 23, 1988, the Hornets\' beat [Michael
Jordan](Michael_Jordan "wikilink") and the [Chicago
Bulls](Chicago_Bulls "wikilink") 103--101 in Jordan\'s first return to
[North Carolina](North_Carolina "wikilink") as a professional.[^18] The
Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20--62. Scheer
left prior to the 1989--90 season.[^19]

Despite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were
a runaway hit, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve
seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out
364 consecutive games.[^20]

The Hornets\' [second
season](1989–90_Charlotte_Hornets_season "wikilink") was a struggle from
start to finish. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter\'s
defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant
[Gene Littles](Gene_Littles "wikilink") following an 8--32 start.
Despite the change, the team continued to struggle, finishing the season
with a disappointing 19--63 record.[^21]

The team showed improvement during the [following
season](1990–91_Charlotte_Hornets_season "wikilink"). They won eight of
their first fifteen games, including a 120--105 victory over the
[Washington Bullets](Washington_Bullets "wikilink"). However, the team
went cold, losing their next eleven games. The Hornets, who hosted the
[1991 NBA All-Star Game](1991_NBA_All-Star_Game "wikilink"), finished
with a 26--56 record.[^22] Despite the team\'s seven-game improvement
over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of the
season and replaced by general manager [Allan
Bristow](Allan_Bristow "wikilink").

With the first pick in the [1991 NBA draft](1991_NBA_draft "wikilink"),
the Hornets drafted [power
forward](power_forward_(basketball) "wikilink") [Larry
Johnson](Larry_Johnson_(basketball,_born_1969) "wikilink") from the
[University of Nevada, Las
Vegas](UNLV_Runnin'_Rebels_basketball "wikilink").[^23] Johnson had an
impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and
rebounds, and winning the 1992 [NBA Rookie of the Year
Award](NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award "wikilink").[^24] Additionally,
Guard [Kendall Gill](Kendall_Gill "wikilink") led the club in scoring,
averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a
playoff spot until March, but finished the year with a 31--51
record.[^25]

#### 1992--1995: Johnson/Mourning era {#johnsonmourning_era}

![The Hornets selected [Larry
Johnson](Larry_Johnson_(basketball,_born_1969) "wikilink") as the 1st
overall pick in the [1991 NBA
draft](1991_NBA_draft "wikilink").](Larry_Johnson_(cropped).jpg "The Hornets selected Larry Johnson as the 1st overall pick in the 1991 NBA draft."){width="200"}
The Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall
pick in the draft, using it to select
[Georgetown](Georgetown_Hoyas_men's_basketball "wikilink") center
[Alonzo Mourning](Alonzo_Mourning "wikilink").[^26][^27] Charlotte now
had two 20--10 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill,
formed perhaps the league\'s top young trio. The team finished [their
fifth season](1992–93_Charlotte_Hornets_season "wikilink") at 44--38,
their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first [playoff
berth](1993_NBA_playoffs "wikilink") in franchise history. Finishing
fifth in the [Eastern Conference](Eastern_Conference_(NBA) "wikilink"),
the Hornets upset the [Boston Celtics](Boston_Celtics "wikilink") in the
first round, with Mourning winning the series with a 20-footer in game
four.[^28] However, the Hornets lacked the experience and depth to
defeat the [New York Knicks](New_York_Knicks "wikilink"), falling in
five games in the second round.[^29]

The Hornets finished the [1993--94
season](1993–94_NBA_season "wikilink") with a 41--41 record, narrowly
missing the playoffs. Despite injuries to both Johnson and Mourning, the
two led the team in points-per-game.[^30]

In the [1994--95 season](1994–95_NBA_season "wikilink"), the Hornets
finished with a 50--32 record, returning to [the
playoffs](1995_NBA_playoffs "wikilink").[^31] Johnson and Mourning again
led the team in points-per-game, while also leading the club in
rebounding. However, Charlotte was bounced from the playoffs in the
first round, falling to the [Chicago Bulls](Chicago_Bulls "wikilink") in
four games.[^32] Following the season, the Hornets traded Mourning to
the [Miami Heat](Miami_Heat "wikilink") for forward [Glen
Rice](Glen_Rice "wikilink"), center [Matt
Geiger](Matt_Geiger "wikilink"), and guard [Khalid
Reeves](Khalid_Reeves "wikilink").[^33]

#### 1995--1998: Glen Rice era {#glen_rice_era}

[Glen Rice](Glen_Rice "wikilink") would make an immediate impact after
joining the Hornets, leading the team in scoring and points-per-game
during the [1995--96 season](1995–96_NBA_season "wikilink"). While Rice
and Johnson provided high-powered scoring, Geiger tied with Johnson for
the team lead in rebounds, and All-Star guard [Kenny
Anderson](Kenny_Anderson_(basketball) "wikilink") ran the point for the
injured [Muggsy Bogues](Muggsy_Bogues "wikilink"). The Hornets were
competitive but failed to qualify for the playoffs, again finishing with
a 41--41 record. [Allan Bristow](Allan_Bristow "wikilink") resigned at
the end of the season, and was replaced by [Dave
Cowens](Dave_Cowens "wikilink").[^34]

The 1996 off-season was again marked by vast changes: Anderson declined
to re-sign, Johnson was shipped to the Knicks for power forward [Anthony
Mason](Anthony_Mason_(basketball) "wikilink"), and the team made a trade
on [draft day 1996](1996_NBA_draft "wikilink"), acquiring center [Vlade
Divac](Vlade_Divac "wikilink") from the [Los Angeles
Lakers](Los_Angeles_Lakers "wikilink") in exchange for the rights to
rookie and future Hall of Famer [Kobe Bryant](Kobe_Bryant "wikilink"),
whom the Hornets picked 13th overall.[^35] The new-look Hornets were
successful, with Divac and Geiger providing the center combination,
Mason averaging a double-double, Bogues back at the point, and Rice
having the finest season of his career. The team achieved the best
season in its history at the time, finishing 54--28, and making it [back
to the playoffs](1997_NBA_playoffs "wikilink").[^36] Despite the success
during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the
Knicks in three games.

The [1997--98 season](1997–98_NBA_season "wikilink") was also
successful. [Muggsy Bogues](Muggsy_Bogues "wikilink") was traded two
games into the season, and the team picked up point guard [David
Wesley](David_Wesley "wikilink") and shooting guard [Bobby
Phills](Bobby_Phills "wikilink").[^37] With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason,
and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with
a 51--31 record.[^38] The Hornets made it to back-to-back playoffs for
the first time in franchise history, advancing to the second round, only
to be stopped by the Bulls.

#### 1998--2002: Final years of original personnel {#final_years_of_original_personnel}

The [1998--99 season](1998–99_NBA_season "wikilink") was shortened. The
season did not start until February, as the lockout shortened the
regular season to only 50 games. Additionally, [Glen
Rice](Glen_Rice "wikilink") was traded to the Lakers for [Eddie
Jones](Eddie_Jones_(basketball) "wikilink") and [Elden
Campbell](Elden_Campbell "wikilink"), and [Dave
Cowens](Dave_Cowens "wikilink") resigned midway through the season.[^39]
He was replaced by former Celtics teammate [Paul
Silas](Paul_Silas "wikilink"), who became the team\'s fifth head
coach.[^40] The team finished with a 26--24 record, but failed to
qualify for the playoffs.

The next three seasons ([1999--2000](1999–2000_NBA_season "wikilink"),
[2000--01](2000–01_NBA_season "wikilink") and
[2001--02](2001–02_NBA_season "wikilink")) saw the Hornets in the
playoffs each year, reaching the conference semifinals twice. Before the
Hornets were eliminated from the 2002 playoffs, the NBA approved a deal
for the team to move to New Orleans following the season and become the
[New Orleans Hornets](New_Orleans_Hornets "wikilink"). The move came
mainly because attendance tailed off dramatically, reportedly due to
Shinn\'s declining popularity in the city.[^41][^42][^43]

### 2004--2014: Charlotte Bobcats {#charlotte_bobcats}

Shortly after the relocation of the team to New Orleans, as well as to
avoid a [Browns-like
lawsuit](Cleveland_Browns_relocation_controversy "wikilink"), the NBA
opened itself to the possibility of adding a replacement team in
Charlotte for the [2004--05 season](2004–05_NBA_season "wikilink"),
provided that an arena deal could be reached.[^44] Several ownership
groups, including one led by former [Boston
Celtics](Boston_Celtics "wikilink") star [Larry
Bird](Larry_Bird "wikilink"), made bids for the franchise.[^45] On
December 18, 2002, a group led by
[BET](Black_Entertainment_Television "wikilink") founder [Robert L.
Johnson](Robert_L._Johnson "wikilink") was awarded the franchise,[^46]
allowing him to become the first [African
American](African_American "wikilink") majority owner in [U.S. major
professional
sports](Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada "wikilink")
since the [Negro leagues](Negro_league_baseball "wikilink").[^47] The
franchise with Johnson as its owner was approved by the NBA Board of
Governors on January 10, 2003.[^48] Hip-hop artist
[Nelly](Nelly "wikilink") became a notable co-owner.[^49] The owners
paid a \$300 million expansion fee to enter the league.[^50]

In June 2003, the team name was officially announced as the
Bobcats.[^51] The Charlotte Regional Sports Commission aided the naming
process with a \"Help Name The Team\" effort that drew over 1,250
suggestions, with \'Flight\' being the winner. However, it was discarded
by Johnson and the team involved in creating the team\'s identity, being
considered abstract and reminiscent of the then-current [Iraq
War](Iraq_War "wikilink") aerial strikes.[^52] Given Charlotte was
already home to a cat-named team, the [Carolina
Panthers](Carolina_Panthers "wikilink") of the [National Football
League](National_Football_League "wikilink"), designer Chris Weiller
made sure to create a logo that would not be similar to the Panthers
logo.[^53] It has also been speculated that Johnson chose the name
\"Bobcats\" in reference to his own name.[^54][^55]

The Bobcats hired [Bernie Bickerstaff](Bernie_Bickerstaff "wikilink") as
the first head coach and [general manager](general_manager "wikilink")
in franchise history.[^56] [A new
arena](Spectrum_Center_(arena) "wikilink") to host the Bobcats in
[uptown Charlotte](Charlotte_center_city "wikilink") began construction
in July 2003. The team would play its home games at the Coliseum until
the new building was ready.

#### 2004--2010: Return to Charlotte {#return_to_charlotte}

![The Bobcats versus the [Dallas Mavericks](Dallas_Mavericks "wikilink")
on November 11,
2005.](BobcatArena.jpg "The Bobcats versus the Dallas Mavericks on November 11, 2005."){width="280"}
The Bobcats held their [expansion
draft](2004_NBA_Expansion_Draft "wikilink") on June 22, 2004, picking up
youngsters such as [Gerald Wallace](Gerald_Wallace "wikilink"), [Primož
Brezec](Primož_Brezec "wikilink"), and [Jason
Kapono](Jason_Kapono "wikilink"). Shortly after, they traded with the
[Los Angeles Clippers](Los_Angeles_Clippers "wikilink") to acquire the
second pick in the [2004 NBA draft](2004_NBA_draft "wikilink"), which
they used to select [center](center_(basketball) "wikilink") [Emeka
Okafor](Emeka_Okafor "wikilink") from
[Connecticut](Connecticut_Huskies_men's_basketball "wikilink"). The
Bobcats\' inaugural game, and the first of their [2004--05
season](2004–05_Charlotte_Bobcats_season "wikilink") took place on
November 4 at the [Charlotte Coliseum](Charlotte_Coliseum "wikilink"),
and was a 103--96 loss to the [Washington
Wizards](Washington_Wizards "wikilink").[^57] Two days later, they won
their first game in franchise history over the [Orlando
Magic](Orlando_Magic "wikilink"), 111--100.[^58] On December 14, the
Bobcats beat the [New Orleans Hornets](New_Orleans_Hornets "wikilink")
in overtime in the team\'s first trip to Charlotte since
relocating.[^59] The Bobcats finished their inaugural season
18--64.[^60] Emeka Okafor, however, won the 2004--05 [NBA Rookie of the
Year Award](NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award "wikilink").[^61]

In the [2005 NBA draft](2005_NBA_draft "wikilink"), the Bobcats drafted
[Raymond Felton](Raymond_Felton "wikilink") and [Sean
May](Sean_May "wikilink") from [North
Carolina](North_Carolina_Tar_Heels_men's_basketball "wikilink").[^62] In
[their second season](2005–06_Charlotte_Bobcats_season "wikilink"), the
Bobcats opened [Charlotte Bobcats
Arena](Spectrum_Center_(arena) "wikilink") with an overtime victory over
the Celtics. Despite struggling for most of the year, they managed to
close out the season with four straight wins to finish with a record of
26--56, an eight-game improvement from the previous season. After the
season, the Bobcats announced that NBA legend and North Carolina native
[Michael Jordan](Michael_Jordan "wikilink") had bought a minority stake
in the team. As part of the deal, he became head of basketball
operations, though Bickerstaff remained general manager.[^63]

The Bobcats showed some improvement during the [2006--07
season](2006–07_Charlotte_Bobcats_season "wikilink"), posting a
playoff-hopeful record of 22--33 late in February 2007. However, the
team went through an eight-game losing streak and dropped their record
to 22--41 by early March 2007. Following the slump, Jordan announced
that Bickerstaff would not return to coach the following season, but
would finish coaching the remainder of the 2006--07 season.[^64] The
Bobcats won 11 of their last 19 games of Bickerstaff\'s tenure to finish
their third season 33--49. On June 3, 2007, [Charlotte
Coliseum](Charlotte_Coliseum "wikilink") was demolished, marking a
bitter end to the original Hornets era as it was the home of
Charlotte\'s original NBA franchise. The arena was only 19 years old,
owned by the city of Charlotte, but was already considered outdated
because of a lack of luxury boxes and suites. The arena was designed for
college basketball as part of Charlotte\'s push to maintain their
presence in the [ACC](Atlantic_Coast_Conference "wikilink") basketball
tournament rotation.[^65]

Front office and coaching were key focuses for the Bobcats during the
2007 off-season. [Rod Higgins](Rod_Higgins "wikilink") was hired as
[general manager](General_manager_(sports) "wikilink"),[^66] and [Sam
Vincent](Sam_Vincent_(basketball) "wikilink") was hired as the second
head coach in franchise history.[^67] In the [2007 NBA
draft](2007_NBA_draft "wikilink"), [Brandan
Wright](Brandan_Wright "wikilink") was selected by the Bobcats with the
eighth pick; he was subsequently traded to Golden State for [Jason
Richardson](Jason_Richardson "wikilink"). The Bobcats were unable to
capitalize on off-season moves, finishing the [2007--08
season](2007–08_Charlotte_Bobcats_season "wikilink") with a 32--50
record. The team struggled amid rumors of players clashing with the
coach.[^68] After a year, during which he struggled with personnel
decisions, [Sam Vincent](Sam_Vincent_(basketball) "wikilink") was fired
in April 2008.[^69]

[thumb\|upright=0.75\|[Michael Jordan](Michael_Jordan "wikilink")
acquired the Bobcats in
2010.](File:Michael_Jordan_in_2014.jpg "wikilink")

On April 29, 2008, the Bobcats reached an agreement to hire [Basketball
Hall of Famer](Basketball_Hall_of_Fame "wikilink") [Larry
Brown](Larry_Brown_(basketball) "wikilink") as the third head coach in
franchise history.[^70] In the [2008 NBA
draft](2008_NBA_draft "wikilink"), the Bobcats selected [D. J.
Augustin](D._J._Augustin "wikilink") from
[Texas](Texas_Longhorns_men's_basketball "wikilink") ninth overall. On
December 10, 2008, a little over a month into the season, the Bobcats
obtained [Boris Diaw](Boris_Diaw "wikilink") and [Raja
Bell](Raja_Bell "wikilink") in a trade with Phoenix. The trade turned
out to be successful as the team came close to reaching the franchise\'s
first playoff berth, but finished four games out of eighth place with a
record of 35--47. Following the season, majority owner [Bob
Johnson](Robert_L._Johnson "wikilink") announced he was putting the team
up for sale.[^71]

During the off-season, the team picked [Gerald
Henderson](Gerald_Henderson_Jr. "wikilink") from
[Duke](Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball "wikilink") 12th overall in the
[2009 NBA draft](2009_NBA_draft "wikilink"). The Bobcats traded [Emeka
Okafor](Emeka_Okafor "wikilink") for New Orleans Hornets\' center [Tyson
Chandler](Tyson_Chandler "wikilink"), and through more trades acquired
[Stephen Jackson](Stephen_Jackson "wikilink") and [Acie
Law](Acie_Law "wikilink") from the [Golden State
Warriors](Golden_State_Warriors "wikilink").[^72] On February 27, 2010,
it was announced that Johnson had decided to sell the team to Jordan,
allowing Jordan to become the first former NBA player to become majority
owner of a franchise.[^73]

On April 9, 2010, the Bobcats clinched their first [playoff
berth](2010_NBA_playoffs "wikilink") since 2002 with a 104--103 road win
over the New Orleans Hornets,[^74] finishing the [2009--10
season](2009–10_Charlotte_Bobcats_season "wikilink") with an overall
record of 44--38, their first-ever winning season. Gerald Wallace was a
huge factor in the playoff run as he became the Bobcats\' first and only
[NBA All-Star](NBA_All-Star "wikilink"). However, the Bobcats were swept
by the [Orlando Magic](Orlando_Magic "wikilink") in four games.[^75]

#### 2010--2014: Final years of the Bobcats {#final_years_of_the_bobcats}

Despite the departures of [Raymond Felton](Raymond_Felton "wikilink")
and [Tyson Chandler](Tyson_Chandler "wikilink"), the Bobcats hoped to
make the playoffs for a [second straight
season](2010–11_Charlotte_Bobcats_season "wikilink"). Following a dismal
9--19 start, Jordan announced that [Larry
Brown](Larry_Brown_(basketball) "wikilink") had stepped down as head
coach.[^76] [Paul Silas](Paul_Silas "wikilink") was hired as their new
head coach the same day.[^77] The Bobcats sent Wallace to the [Portland
Trail Blazers](Portland_Trail_Blazers "wikilink") and received two
first-round draft picks, [Joel Przybilla](Joel_Przybilla "wikilink"),
[Sean Marks](Sean_Marks "wikilink"), and [Dante
Cunningham](Dante_Cunningham "wikilink"), also acquiring [D. J.
White](D._J._White "wikilink") and [Morris
Peterson](Morris_Peterson "wikilink") in a trade with the Thunder.[^78]
Going down the stretch, injuries to both [Stephen
Jackson](Stephen_Jackson "wikilink") and [Tyrus
Thomas](Tyrus_Thomas "wikilink") derailed any chances of Charlotte
trying to catch the [Indiana Pacers](Indiana_Pacers "wikilink") for the
eighth spot in the east. In the end, the Bobcats finished the season
with a 34--48 record overall, finishing 25--29 under Silas.

#### 2011--2019: Kemba Walker era {#kemba_walker_era}

[thumb\|upright=0.85\|The Bobcats selected [Kemba
Walker](Kemba_Walker "wikilink") as the 9th overall pick in the [2011
NBA
draft](2011_NBA_draft "wikilink").](File:Kemba_Walker_2019.jpg "wikilink")
On June 13, 2011, the Bobcats made some changes to their front office by
hiring former Trail Blazers general manager [Rich
Cho](Rich_Cho "wikilink") to the same position and promoting Rod Higgins
to President of Basketball Operations.[^79] During the [2011 NBA
draft](2011_NBA_draft "wikilink") the Bobcats sent Jackson, [Shaun
Livingston](Shaun_Livingston "wikilink"), and the 19th pick to Milwaukee
and received [Corey Maggette](Corey_Maggette "wikilink") and the 7th
pick in return. The Bobcats used that pick to draft [Bismack
Biyombo](Bismack_Biyombo "wikilink") and with their 9th pick drafted
[Connecticut\'s](Connecticut_Huskies_men's_basketball "wikilink") [Kemba
Walker](Kemba_Walker "wikilink"), the [NCAA basketball tournament Most
Outstanding
Player](NCAA_basketball_tournament_Most_Outstanding_Player "wikilink").[^80]

In the lockout-shortened 2011--12 season, Charlotte lost often,
including their last 23 games. During their season finale against the
[New York Knicks](New_York_Knicks "wikilink"), the Bobcats recorded yet
another loss as their win percentage dropped to .106, setting a new
record for the worst season ever by an NBA team (as this season was
shortened by the lockout, the 1972--73 [Philadelphia
76ers](Philadelphia_76ers "wikilink") still hold the record for most
losses in a season with 73). Overall, the team\'s record was 7--59. On
April 30, 2012, the Bobcats announced that Silas would not return as
head coach.[^81] [St. John\'s](St._John's_Red_Storm "wikilink")
assistant [Mike Dunlap](Mike_Dunlap "wikilink") was named as his
successor.[^82]

Despite finishing the season with the worst record in NBA history, the
Bobcats received the second overall pick.[^83] With the second pick in
the [2012 NBA draft](2012_NBA_draft "wikilink"), the Bobcats selected
[Michael Kidd-Gilchrist](Michael_Kidd-Gilchrist "wikilink") and selected
[Jeffery Taylor](Jeffery_Taylor "wikilink") with the 31st pick.[^84]
They also added [Ben Gordon](Ben_Gordon "wikilink"), [Ramon
Sessions](Ramon_Sessions "wikilink") and [Brendan
Haywood](Brendan_Haywood "wikilink") in free agency. The Bobcats won
their first game against the Pacers, snapping their 23-game losing
streak. The team seemed to rebound with a 7--5 start to the season.
However, they promptly went on an 18-game losing streak from which they
never recovered, snapping the streak with a win at Chicago. Charlotte
finished 21--61, the second-worst record in the league.[^85] Dunlap was
fired on April 23, reportedly because the players were turned off by his
heavy-handed coaching style. He would be replaced by former [Los Angeles
Lakers](Los_Angeles_Lakers "wikilink") assistant head coach [Steve
Clifford](Steve_Clifford "wikilink").

During the [2013 NBA draft](2013_NBA_draft "wikilink"), the Bobcats
selected power forward/center [Cody Zeller](Cody_Zeller "wikilink") 4th
overall.[^86] The Bobcats would also obtain former [Utah
Jazz](Utah_Jazz "wikilink") center [Al
Jefferson](Al_Jefferson "wikilink") in free agency.[^87] In February
2014, the team received [Gary Neal](Gary_Neal "wikilink") and [Luke
Ridnour](Luke_Ridnour "wikilink") in a trade with the Bucks. The new
players and coaching staff worked as the Bobcats clinched a [playoff
berth](2014_NBA_playoffs "wikilink") for the second time in franchise
history by beating Cleveland on the road. Charlotte finished the regular
season 43--39.[^88] However, the Bobcats were swept in four games by
defending champion Miami in the first round.[^89]

### 2014--present: Return of the Hornets {#present_return_of_the_hornets}

On May 21, 2013, Jordan officially announced the organization had
submitted an application to change the name of the franchise to the
Charlotte Hornets for the 2014--15 NBA season, pending a majority vote
for approval by the NBA Board of Governors at a meeting in [Las
Vegas](Las_Vegas_Valley "wikilink") on July 18, 2013.[^90] The NBA
announced, on July 18, 2013, that it had unanimously approved the
rebranding, which would begin upon the conclusion of the 2013--14
season.[^91]

The Bobcats announced on November 22, they would adopt a modified
version of the original Hornets\' teal-purple-white color palette, with
black, gray and Carolina blue as accents.[^92][^93] The team officially
unveiled its future logo and identity scheme during halftime of their
December 21 game against the Jazz.[^94] The team also started the \"Buzz
City\" campaign to hype up the Hornets return.[^95] On January 16, 2014,
the Bobcats revealed new Hornets shirts, hats and gear.[^96]

On May 20, 2014, the Bobcats officially became the second incarnation of
the Charlotte Hornets. At a press conference regarding the change, team
officials also announced that as part of a deal with the NBA and the
renamed [New Orleans Pelicans](New_Orleans_Pelicans "wikilink"),
Charlotte acquired the history and records of the 1988--2002 Hornets (in
a move similar to that of the [National Football
League](National_Football_League "wikilink")\'s [Cleveland
Browns](Cleveland_Browns "wikilink") return to the league in
[1999](1999_NFL_Season "wikilink")), while all of the Hornets\' records
during their time in New Orleans from 2002 to 2013 remained with the
Pelicans.[^97][^98][^99] The Hornets are now
[retconned](retroactive_continuity "wikilink") as having suspended
operations from 2002 to 2004, while the Pelicans are considered a 2002
expansion team. Charlotte had already been using past footage of the
original Hornets as part of the \"Buzz City\" campaign.

#### 2014--2020: Playoffs and struggles {#playoffs_and_struggles}

In the [2014 NBA draft](2014_NBA_draft "wikilink"), the Hornets had the
9th overall pick from an earlier trade with the [Detroit
Pistons](Detroit_Pistons "wikilink"), which they used to select [Noah
Vonleh](Noah_Vonleh "wikilink") from
[Indiana](Indiana_Hoosiers_men's_basketball "wikilink").[^100] In the
same draft they acquired [UConn
Husky](UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball "wikilink") [Shabazz
Napier](Shabazz_Napier "wikilink"), [Dwight
Powell](Dwight_Powell "wikilink") from
[Stanford](Stanford_Cardinal_men's_basketball "wikilink"), and [Semaj
Christon](Semaj_Christon "wikilink") from
[Xavier](Xavier_Musketeers_men's_basketball "wikilink") in the second
round. They later traded Napier to the Heat for [P. J.
Hairston](P._J._Hairston "wikilink") (formerly from
[UNC](North_Carolina_Tar_Heels_men's_basketball "wikilink")), the rights
to the 55th pick, Miami\'s 2019 second-round pick and cash
considerations.[^101] The team also picked up [Scotty
Hopson](Scotty_Hopson "wikilink") (whom they would trade to New Orleans)
and cash considerations in free agency.

During their first year of free agency as the Hornets, the team signed
former Pacers shooting guard [Lance
Stephenson](Lance_Stephenson "wikilink"). The Hornets also signed former
Jazz and [Atlanta Hawks](Atlanta_Hawks "wikilink") forward [Marvin
Williams](Marvin_Williams "wikilink") to a two-year deal.[^102] A mostly
difficult year led to a 33--49 record overall and a 4th-place finish in
the division.[^103] Stephenson was traded to the [Los Angeles
Clippers](Los_Angeles_Clippers "wikilink") for [Spencer
Hawes](Spencer_Hawes "wikilink") and [Matt
Barnes](Matt_Barnes "wikilink") who was later traded to the [Memphis
Grizzlies](Memphis_Grizzlies "wikilink") for [Courtney
Lee](Courtney_Lee "wikilink").[^104]

The [following year](2015–16_Charlotte_Hornets_season "wikilink"), the
team improved to 48--34 overall, following the acquisition of players
such as [Nicolas Batum](Nicolas_Batum "wikilink"), [Jeremy
Lamb](Jeremy_Lamb "wikilink"), and [Jeremy
Lin](Jeremy_Lin "wikilink").[^105] It was the best season in franchise
history since the original Hornets era. Charlotte returned to the
playoffs, where they lost to the Heat in seven games in the first
round.[^106] Along the way, they defeated the Heat twice at Time Warner
Cable Arena, the franchise\'s first playoff wins since the original
Hornets era.

In the off-season, Jeremy Lin would go to sign with the [Brooklyn
Nets](Brooklyn_Nets "wikilink"), [Al Jefferson](Al_Jefferson "wikilink")
to the [Indiana Pacers](Indiana_Pacers "wikilink"), and [Courtney
Lee](Courtney_Lee "wikilink") to the [New York
Knicks](New_York_Knicks "wikilink"), but the Hornets were able to
re-sign Nicolas Batum and Marvin Williams, as well as bring in former
All-star [Roy Hibbert](Roy_Hibbert "wikilink"), [Marco
Belinelli](Marco_Belinelli "wikilink") and [Ramon
Sessions](Ramon_Sessions "wikilink") for a second stint.[^107][^108]
Hibbert would be traded mid-season to the [Milwaukee
Bucks](Milwaukee_Bucks "wikilink") with [Spencer
Hawes](Spencer_Hawes "wikilink") for center [Miles
Plumlee](Miles_Plumlee "wikilink"). [Kemba
Walker](Kemba_Walker "wikilink") was named an Eastern Conference
All-star as a reserve, the first all-star game of his career. The
Hornets would finish the season with a 36--46 record, missing out on the
playoffs.

The Hornets had a successful 2017 off-season. They shipped Plumlee and
Belinelli and the 41st pick in the [2017 NBA
draft](2017_NBA_draft "wikilink") to the [Atlanta
Hawks](Atlanta_Hawks "wikilink") for former All-star [Dwight
Howard](Dwight_Howard "wikilink") and the 31st pick in the 2017
draft.[^109] The trade reunited Howard with head coach Steve Clifford,
both of whom worked together during Howard\'s time in Orlando and Los
Angeles.[^110] In the draft, Charlotte selected [Malik
Monk](Malik_Monk "wikilink") with the 11th overall pick, as well as
[Frank Jackson](Frank_Jackson_(basketball) "wikilink") with the 31st
pick.[^111] They then sent Jackson to New Orleans for cash
considerations and swing-man [Dwayne Bacon](Dwayne_Bacon "wikilink") who
was drafted 40th overall. Sessions signed with the [New York
Knicks](New_York_Knicks "wikilink"), and, to replace the backup guard,
they brought in former rookie of the year [Michael
Carter-Williams](Michael_Carter-Williams "wikilink") from the [Chicago
Bulls](Chicago_Bulls "wikilink").[^112]

In the 2017--18 season Kemba Walker was selected for his second NBA
All-Star appearance and passed Dell Curry for most three-pointers and
the all-time leading scorer. At the end of the 2017--18 season, the
Hornets did not renew the contract of general manager Rich Cho. In April
2018, [Mitch Kupchak](Mitch_Kupchak "wikilink") was named as the new
president of basketball operations and general manager.[^113] On April
13, 2018, the Hornets fired head coach Steve Clifford after five
seasons, who coached the team to a 196--214 record total,[^114] and
named [James Borrego](James_Borrego "wikilink") as his replacement on
May 10.[^115]

On July 23, 2018, [Tony Parker](Tony_Parker "wikilink"), who spent the
previous 17 years of his career with the [San Antonio
Spurs](San_Antonio_Spurs "wikilink"), signed with the Hornets.[^116] In
January 2019 Kemba Walker was named an All-Star Game starter for the
Eastern Conference, his first starting role in an All-Star Game, and
matched only Glen Rice for his third All-Star Game appearance in his
Hornets career.[^117] During the [2018--19
season](2018–19_Charlotte_Hornets_season "wikilink"), Charlotte finished
the season with a 39--43 record finishing 2nd in the division and 9th in
the Eastern Conference.

On June 20, 2019, the Hornets selected [P. J.
Washington](P._J._Washington "wikilink") with the twelfth overall pick
in the [2019 NBA draft](2019_NBA_draft "wikilink").[^118]

On July 6, 2019, Kemba Walker joined the [Boston
Celtics](Boston_Celtics "wikilink") through a sign-and-trade deal with
the Hornets.[^119]

#### 2020--present: LaMelo Ball era {#present_lamelo_ball_era}

![The Hornets selected [LaMelo Ball](LaMelo_Ball "wikilink") as the 3rd
overall pick in the [2020 NBA
draft](2020_NBA_draft "wikilink").](D1PWRLD.png "The Hornets selected LaMelo Ball as the 3rd overall pick in the 2020 NBA draft.")
On November 18, 2020, the Hornets selected [LaMelo
Ball](LaMelo_Ball "wikilink") with the third overall pick.[^120] The
Hornets also drafted [Vernon Carey Jr.](Vernon_Carey_Jr. "wikilink") and
[Grant Riller](Grant_Riller "wikilink") in the second round of the [2020
NBA draft](2020_NBA_draft "wikilink").[^121] On November 29, 2020, the
Hornets would acquire [Gordon Hayward](Gordon_Hayward "wikilink") in a
sign-and-trade deal with the [Boston
Celtics](Boston_Celtics "wikilink").[^122] The Hornets finished the
2020--21 season 10th in the East with a 33--39 overall record.[^123] On
June 16, 2021, Ball was named 2020--21 NBA Rookie of the Year, becoming
the third player in franchise history to win the award.[^124]

On February 7, 2022, Ball was named to his first [NBA
All-Star](NBA_All-Star_Game "wikilink") Game as an injury replacement
for [Kevin Durant](Kevin_Durant "wikilink").[^125] The Hornets would
clinch a spot in the [play-in
tournament](NBA_play-in_tournament "wikilink") for the second
consecutive time although losing to fellow Southeast division foe the
[Atlanta Hawks](Atlanta_Hawks "wikilink") 132--103.[^126] On April 22,
2022, the Hornets fired head coach [James
Borrego](James_Borrego "wikilink") after four seasons with the
team.[^127][^128] The team finished the 2021--2022 season with a 43--39
overall record.[^129]

On June 24, 2022, the Hornets named [Steve
Clifford](Steve_Clifford "wikilink") as new head coach marking his
second stint as the team\'s head coach.[^130] During the off-season,
notable additions included drafting
[Duke](Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball "wikilink") center [Mark
Williams](Mark_Williams_(basketball) "wikilink") with the 15th pick of
the [2022 NBA draft](2022_NBA_draft "wikilink") and the free agent
signing of point guard and North Carolina native [Dennis Smith
Jr.](Dennis_Smith_Jr. "wikilink")[^131][^132] During the [2022-23 NBA
season](2022-23_NBA_season "wikilink"), the Hornets endured injuries to
a majority of the roster, leading to a poor season which ended with a
27-55 record, the fourth worst in the league. However, [Mark
Williams](Mark_Williams_(basketball) "wikilink") proved his immense
potential.

Courtesy of their poor finish, the Hornets won the second pick in the
[2023 NBA draft](2023_NBA_draft "wikilink").

## Logos and uniforms {#logos_and_uniforms}

### Logos

![Charlotte Hornets wordmark
logo](Charlotte_hornets-wordmark.png "Charlotte Hornets wordmark logo")
The Hornets\' first logo was a [teal and purple anthropomorphic
hornet](Hugo_(mascot) "wikilink") wearing white shoes and gloves
dribbling an orange basketball. The words \'Charlotte Hornets\' were in
teal and curved across the top and bottom of the logo. An alternate
logo, used only for the 1988--89 season, featured a large teal letter
\'C\', with \'Charlotte\' in black letters curved upwards underneath.
Inside the \'C\' was a smaller white letter \'H\' outlined in teal, with
a black-colored hornet holding a basketball from birds-eye view placed
in the center. The \'H\' portion of the logo remained on the warm-ups
and waistband of the jerseys until the 1991--92
season.`{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}`{=mediawiki}

The Bobcats\' primary logo from 2004 to 2012 consisted of a snarling
orange bobcat facing to the right with the indented name \'Bobcats\'
above in silver on a blue background, with \'Charlotte\' (also indented)
appearing above it in the same blue color. A change to a less vibrant
orange and blue, while retaining the same look, was made in 2007.
Further color changes in 2012 made the bobcat gray, extended the blue
background up to the \'Charlotte\' name, which changed from blue to
orange. A Carolina blue outline around the entire logo was also added.
In 2007 the Bobcats unveiled a secondary logo, consisting of a snarling
bobcat head facing forward with one side shaded orange, and the other
blue. A silver basketball was placed behind the right of the head, all
encased in an orange-blue-gray circle. During the 2012 rebranding, the
colors were changed, with gray and Carolina blue replacing orange on the
head and circle outline, respectively, and the basketball changing to
orange. This logo would become prominent in the team\'s marketing and be
featured at center court from 2007--08 until 2013--14.

Charlotte\'s second Hornets logo features a teal and purple
forward-facing hornet with the words \'Charlotte Hornets\' on its torso.
Wings sprout up above the head on both left and right, with teal and
purple details. The hornet\'s stinger is prominently featured; a
basketball pattern is above the stinger. Gray fully outlines the
logo.[^133] Among the team\'s different secondary logos includes a
hornet facing to the side, its teal and purple body arched in a \'C\'
shape representing the city of Charlotte, and a modified version of the
Hornets original logo (sans the basketball) as the official mascot
logo.[^134]

### Uniforms

#### Original Hornets {#original_hornets}

The original Hornets uniforms were designed by international designer
and North Carolina native [Alexander
Julian](Alexander_Julian "wikilink"). The team chose teal and purple as
its primary colors and featured a first for NBA uniforms---pinstripes.
While most teams feature team names on home jerseys and their home city
on away jerseys, the Hornets\' uniforms had \"Charlotte\" on both home
and away jerseys. Home uniforms were white with pinstripes in teal,
green, blue and purple, while the away jerseys were teal with pinstripes
in white, green, blue and purple. The
\'[Hugo](Hugo_(mascot) "wikilink")\' logo was prominently featured on
the shorts\' beltline, beginning in early
1992.`{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}`{=mediawiki}

In 1994, the Hornets unveiled a purple alternate uniform, with
pinstripes in white, green, blue and teal. Likewise, Hugo was featured
in the beltline.

From 1997 to 2002, the Hornets made slight changes to their uniforms.
Hugo was moved from the beltline to the left leg, while side stripes
with pinstripes were added, in purple (away) and teal (home) colors. A
tricolor featuring teal, purple and blue was featured on the beltline
and the piping.

#### Bobcats

![[Al Jefferson](Al_Jefferson "wikilink") wearing Bobcats uniform design
that was featured from 2012 to
2014](Al_Jefferson_Bobcats.jpg "Al Jefferson wearing Bobcats uniform design that was featured from 2012 to 2014")
The Bobcats\' first home [jerseys](Jersey_(clothing) "wikilink") were
white, reading \"Bobcats\" in orange with blue and black trimming. The
primary away jersey was orange reading \"Charlotte\" in white with blue
and black trimming.[^135] In the 2006 off-season, the Bobcats announced
a new alternate away jersey which debuted during the 2006--07 season.
The alternate jersey is blue, with the name \"Bobcats\" in white with
black, orange and white
trimming.`{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}`{=mediawiki} Racing Day blue
alternates (with an arched \'Charlotte\', checkered flag side stripes,
and centered numbers) were used to honor Charlotte\'s
[NASCAR](NASCAR "wikilink") fanbase.

For the 2009--10 season, the Bobcats sported redesigned uniforms, having
a mixture of characteristics from both Hornets and Bobcats uniforms. The
home uniforms were white and featured an arched \"Bobcats\" in blue with
orange and white trim. Road uniforms were blue and featured an arched
\"Charlotte\" in white with blue and orange trim. Both designs featured
silver pinstripes, similar to what the Hornets wore. The NASCAR uniform
was also updated to include the pinstripes. For the 2011--12 season,
however, the Bobcats wore their home uniforms on NASCAR night, complete
with a [racing flag](Racing_flags#The_chequered_flag "wikilink") patch.

The Bobcats unveiled [Hardwood Classics](Hardwood_Classics "wikilink")
uniforms honoring the [American Basketball
Association](American_Basketball_Association "wikilink") (ABA)\'s
[Carolina Cougars](Carolina_Cougars "wikilink"), which the team wore for
select games in 2012.[^136]

The Bobcats unveiled new uniforms on June 19, 2012, their second and
final change in five years. Overall, they featured less emphasis on
orange. The white home uniforms sported the shorter nickname \'Cats\' in
navy and [Carolina blue](Carolina_blue "wikilink") trim, while the
numbers were in Carolina blue and navy trim, with navy side stripes. The
navy away uniforms featured \'Charlotte\' in white and Carolina blue
trim, with the numbers featured the same trim as the city name, with
Carolina blue side stripes. In both uniforms, the pinstripes were
relegated to the sides. The uniforms bore a close resemblance to the
[Dallas Mavericks](Dallas_Mavericks "wikilink") uniforms. The addition
of Carolina blue was seen as way to connect owner Michael Jordan\'s
[collegiate
roots](North_Carolina_Tar_Heels_men's_basketball "wikilink"), while the
formal adoption of \'Cats\' for marketing purposes reflected a popular
nickname.[^137]

#### Revived Hornets {#revived_hornets}

![[Cody Zeller](Cody_Zeller "wikilink") in 2016, wearing revived Hornets
uniform design with teal and dark
purple](Cody_Zeller_(31538663811).jpg "Cody Zeller in 2016, wearing revived Hornets uniform design with teal and dark purple")
The newly renamed Hornets unveiled the team\'s uniforms on June 19,
2014, consisting of white home and purple road uniforms with the
\"Hornets\" wordmark across the chest. The team also unveiled a teal
alternate uniform with the \"Charlotte\" wordmark across the chest. The
teal uniform is planned to be used as an alternate uniform for either
home or road games and worn a total of 16--20 times per season.[^138]

On June 25, 2015, the Hornets unveiled a black sleeved alternate
uniform, featuring their \"Buzz City\" nickname in front. The team wore
the uniform for as many as six games during the [2015--16 NBA
season](2015–16_NBA_season "wikilink").[^139] It was also worn during
select games of the [2016 NBA playoffs](2016_NBA_playoffs "wikilink").

For the 2017--18 season and beyond, the Hornets have been outfitted by
[Nike](Nike,_Inc. "wikilink")\'s [Air Jordan](Air_Jordan "wikilink")
brand endorsed by franchise owner Michael Jordan. The white
\"Association\" uniform and the teal \"Icon\" uniform feature the
\"Hornets\" wordmark in front and the silhouetted hornet on the
waistband.[^140] The purple \"Statement\" uniform is similar to the
\"Icon\" and \"Association\" uniforms, but feature the \"Charlotte\"
wordmark in front.[^141]

The Hornets revamped their purple \"Statement\" uniforms prior to the
2019--20 season. The front of the uniform featured the \"CHA\" acronym
in bold white letters with teal trim, while teal \"stinger\" stripes
accentuate the sides. The silhouetted Hornets logo was moved to the
sides of the shorts while the partial logo was placed on the
beltline.[^142]

On August 31, 2020, the Hornets unveiled new uniforms that include
double pinstriped jerseys that pay homage to the jerseys worn from 1997
until 2002. These are the first Hornets regular jerseys to include
pinstripes since they wore them as the Bobcats from 2009 to 2012.[^143]

Before the 2022--23 season, the Hornets again made slight changes to the
purple \"Statement\" uniform. The uniform brought back the \"Hornets\"
wordmark in front along with white numbers and teal cell accents on each
side. The \"C\" alternate logo was added on the beltline and the
alternate \"curled hornet\" logo was placed below the teal cells on the
shorts.[^144]

The Hornets\' \"City\" uniforms were slight updates of Adidas\' sleeved
\"Buzz City\" uniforms. The 2017--18 version featured black letters with
white trim on a black base and the sides featured a wing pattern of a
hornet.[^145] The 2018--19 version was slightly tweaked to feature teal
lettering and a new logo reminiscent of the original Air Jordan
\"Wings\" logo.[^146]

The \"City\" uniform for the 2019--20 season moved away from the \"Buzz
City\" concept and went with a cool grey base, purple, teal and black
piping, \"CHA\" acronym in purple and white numbers with purple trim. A
cell pattern adorned the sides.[^147][^148]

Charlotte\'s \"City\" uniform for the 2020--21 season paid homage to the
city\'s history as the first to house a [U.S. Branch
Mint](Charlotte_Mint "wikilink") and the [Carolina Gold
Rush](Carolina_Gold_Rush "wikilink"). The base color is
[mint](spring_green "wikilink") and letters and numbers are in granite
black with metallic gold trim. Pinstripes are in gold. It also brought
back the \"Buzz City\" crest in front.[^149] This theme was then
revisited in their 2022--23 \"City\" uniform, this in granite black with
\"[CLT](Charlotte_Douglas_International_Airport "wikilink")\"
(Charlotte\'s main abbreviation) in gold with mint trim. Pinstripes
alternate between gold and mint.[^150]

For the 2021--22 season, the Hornets\' \"City\" uniform visually mixed
various elements from previous identities. The cursive \"Charlotte\"
wordmark was inspired by the banners displayed during the franchise\'s
1988 uniform unveiling. The number placement on the left chest was
reminiscent of the Bobcats\' original uniforms. The purple cells
recalled the court design used at the Charlotte Coliseum, and the teal
gradient contained pinstripes, reminiscent of the uniforms worn from
1988 to 1997. The original \"Hugo\" logo was placed on the left leg, and
the script \"Hornets\" wordmark was added to the right leg. Along the
jock tag the Hornets added the \"EST. 1988\" sign acknowledging the
team\'s inaugural year.[^151]

The \"Classic\" edition featured a revival of the original Hornets
pinstriped uniforms in the current Nike template. The teal version was
used in the 2017--18 season,[^152] followed by a white version in
2018--19, complete with an alternate court marking the 30th anniversary
of NBA basketball in Charlotte.[^153] For 2019--20, the Hornets wore
purple versions of the pinstriped uniforms to commemorate the 25th
anniversary of the uniform\'s unveiling.[^154]

## Arenas

-   [Charlotte Coliseum](Charlotte_Coliseum "wikilink") (1988--2002,
    2004--2005)[^155]
-   [Spectrum Center](Spectrum_Center_(arena) "wikilink")
    (2005--present) `<small>`{=html}(known as Charlotte Bobcats Arena
    from 2005 to 2008 and Time Warner Cable Arena from 2008 to
    2016)`</small>`{=html}[^156]

The Hornets played their first 15 seasons at the [Charlotte
Coliseum](Charlotte_Coliseum "wikilink"), which was called \"The Hive\"
by fans. With over 23,000 seats, it was (and still remains) the largest
basketball-specific venue in the league by seating capacity. The
Coliseum hosted 371 consecutive NBA sell-outs (including seven playoff
games) from December 1988 to November 1997.[^157] The Hornets would go
on to lead the NBA in attendance in eight of its first nine seasons.
When Charlotte returned to the NBA as the Bobcats, they temporarily
played in the Coliseum in the 2004--05 season while their new arena (the
Charlotte Bobcats Arena) was being built. After its completion, the city
closed the old Coliseum in the 2005 off-season and opened the new arena
with a [Rolling Stones](Rolling_Stones "wikilink") concert. In April
2008, the Bobcats reached a [naming rights](naming_rights "wikilink")
deal with [Time Warner Cable](Time_Warner_Cable "wikilink"), North
Carolina\'s largest [cable television](cable_television "wikilink")
provider. In exchange for the naming rights, Time Warner agreed to tear
up the cable television deal that had limited the Bobcats\' exposure
over the team\'s first four years (see below).[^158][^159] When the
Hornets returned to Charlotte, \"The Hive\" nickname also returned to
the arena. In August 2016, the arena was renamed the Spectrum Center
after Time Warner\'s merger with [Charter
Communications](Charter_Communications "wikilink") and its
[Spectrum](Charter_Spectrum "wikilink") consumer/business
branding.[^160]

The Hornets practice at the **Novant Health Training Center**, located
within the Spectrum Center. Previously the team practiced at the [Grady
Cole Center](Grady_Cole_Center "wikilink") in the Elizabeth neighborhood
before moving to a purpose-built facility in [Fort Mill, South
Carolina](Fort_Mill,_South_Carolina "wikilink") located beside [Knights
Castle](Knights_Castle "wikilink"), this facility is now known as **The
Pointe Arts and Recreation Center**.

### Retained draft rights {#retained_draft_rights}

The Hornets hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks
who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player is ostensibly
either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed
by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams.
In this case, the team retains the player\'s draft rights in the NBA
until one year after the player\'s contract with the non-NBA team
ends.[^161] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from
trades with other teams.

## Mascot and cheerleaders {#mascot_and_cheerleaders}

![The original Hugo in New
Orleans](PoBoyFest08Buzz.jpg "The original Hugo in New Orleans") **[Hugo
The Hornet](Hugo_(mascot) "wikilink")** is the current
[mascot](mascot "wikilink") of the franchise, and was retained by the
[New Orleans Hornets](New_Orleans_Hornets "wikilink") after the
Charlotte Hornets departure in 2002, until the New Orleans franchise\'s
rebranding as the Pelicans. Shortly after the news that the Bobcats
would get the Hornets name back, at halftime of a December 21, 2013,
game between the Bobcats and the [Utah Jazz](Utah_Jazz "wikilink"), Hugo
was announced to return as the Charlotte Hornets\' new mascot for the
2014--15 NBA season.[^188]

From 2004 to 2014, **Rufus D. Lynx** was the mascot of the
Bobcats.[^189][^190] He first appeared on November 1, 2003, according to
his official bio on the Bobcats\' website. The name comes from the
scientific name of the [bobcat](bobcat "wikilink"), which is *Lynx
rufus*. During the [2012 NBA
All-Star](2012_NBA_All-Star_Game "wikilink") Jam Session, Rufus D. Lynx
broke a world record along with
[Coyote](The_Coyote_(mascot) "wikilink"),
[Grizz](Grizz_(mascot) "wikilink"),
[Hooper](Hooper_(mascot) "wikilink"), and Sly the Silver Fox for most
\"between the legs\" basketball dunks.[^191][^192] [Bleacher
Report](Bleacher_Report "wikilink") ranked Rufus as the 8th best mascot
in the NBA.[^193] Rufus D. Lynx is featured in *[NBA Jam
2010](NBA_Jam_(2010_video_game) "wikilink")*.[^194] Rufus D. Lynx was
officially retired following the conclusion of the 2013--14 NBA season,
and the Hornets made him a farewell video in May 2014.[^195] The updated
**Hugo** was unveiled on an around the city tour on June 5, 2014.[^196]

The Hornets have an official
[cheerleading](National_Basketball_Association_Cheerleading "wikilink")
squad known as the [Charlotte Honey
Bees](Charlotte_Honey_Bees "wikilink"). The Honey Bees perform sideline
dances as well as center-court dances during games. They also represent
the Hornets brand as ambassadors to the community and are involved in
community service activities and charity functions. When the team was
known as the Bobcats, the cheerleaders were called the Lady Cats.[^197]

## Media coverage {#media_coverage}

```{=mediawiki}
{{main|List of Charlotte Hornets broadcasters}}
```
From 1988 to 1992, the Hornets aired most road games, and occasional
home games, on a network of stations in North Carolina, [South
Carolina](South_Carolina "wikilink") and [Virginia](Virginia "wikilink")
fronted by [WCCB](WCCB "wikilink") in Charlotte. WCCB\'s longtime owner,
[Cy Bahakel](Cy_Bahakel "wikilink"), was a minority partner in the
Hornets\' original ownership group. Starting with the 1990--91 season,
several games also aired on the original SportSouth, forerunner of
[Bally Sports South](Bally_Sports_South "wikilink"), for customers in
North and South Carolina. [WJZY](WJZY "wikilink") became the Hornets\'
over-the-air flagship in 1992, and remained as such until 1998. From
1995 to 1998, some games aired on WJZY\'s sister station, WFVT-TV (now
[WMYT-TV](WMYT-TV "wikilink")). [WAXN-TV](WAXN-TV "wikilink") became the
flagship for the 1998--99 season, and remained as such until the
original team departed in 2002. Generally, most home games slated for
telecast aired on SportSouth/Fox Sports South.[^198]

When the team returned as the Bobcats in 2004, Johnson partnered with
Time Warner to create [Carolinas Sports Entertainment
Television](Carolinas_Sports_Entertainment_Television "wikilink")
(C-SET), a [regional sports
network](regional_sports_network "wikilink"). It aired 60 Bobcats games
that also aired on [Comporium
Cable](Comporium_Communications "wikilink") in the South Carolina
portion of the Charlotte market. However, Time Warner placed C-SET on
its [digital package](digital_cable "wikilink") as an incentive to try
to get customers to switch to its digital service, leaving analog
customers in the dark. It also refused to allow
[DirecTV](DirecTV "wikilink") or [Dish Network](Dish_Network "wikilink")
to pick up C-SET on their local feeds. As a result, Time Warner
customers without digital cable, as well as [western North
Carolina](western_North_Carolina "wikilink") and most of South Carolina,
were left to rely on radio coverage.

C-SET folded on the day of the 2005 NBA draft, and most games then moved
to [News 14 Carolina](News_14_Carolina "wikilink"), a cable news channel
available on Time Warner Cable\'s systems in Charlotte, the
[Triad](Piedmont_Triad "wikilink") and the
[Triangle](Research_Triangle "wikilink"). However, this still left
viewers in most of South Carolina (except for the South Carolina side of
the Charlotte area, which saw games on Comporium) as well as
[eastern](Eastern_North_Carolina "wikilink") and western North Carolina,
out in the cold. News 14 was also not available on satellite.

As part of the Time Warner Cable Arena deal, the Bobcats signed over
broadcasting rights to Fox Sports South. Starting with the last five
games of the 2007--08 season, about 70 games per season were shown on
Fox Sports Carolinas (Fox Sports South\'s new regional feed, now
reintegrated to [Bally Sports South](Bally_Sports_South "wikilink")) and
sister network Sportsouth (renamed Fox Sports Southeast in 2015 and
later [Bally Sports Southeast](Bally_Sports_Southeast "wikilink") in
2021) in North and South Carolina. The deal is believed to be the first
simultaneous naming rights and broadcast rights deal in the history of
North American professional sports.[^199] As of the 2020--21 season,
Hornets games are carried by Bally Sports Southeast with [Eric
Collins](Eric_Collins "wikilink") and [Dell
Curry](Dell_Curry "wikilink"), along with in-game reporter and *Hornets
Live* host Ashley ShahAhmadi.[^200] Former personnel include: [Stephanie
Ready](Stephanie_Ready "wikilink"), who worked as a sideline reporter
and in-game analyst for the Hornets for a decade before moving to
[Turner Sports](Turner_Sports "wikilink") in 2018, and long time Hornets
broadcaster [Steve Martin](Steve_Martin_(sportscaster) "wikilink"), who
retired after the 2017--18 season.[^201]

For the team\'s first four seasons after their return to the league,
select games also aired on a network of over-the-air stations across
North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, fronted by WJZY from 2004
to 2006 and WMYT from 2006 to 2008.

The team\'s radio flagship is all-sports station
[WFNZ-FM](WFNZ-FM "wikilink"). Before 2010, games had aired on
[WOLS](WOLS "wikilink"). WOLS switched its non-sports programming from
[oldies](oldies "wikilink") to Spanish language on January 1, 2009,
making Bobcats and Duke basketball the station\'s only non-Spanish
language programming. [WBT](WBT_(radio_station) "wikilink") was the
Hornets\' radio flagship during the original franchise\'s entire run.
